                disputes arising in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled
                under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International
                Chamber of Commerce by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with
                the said rules. The parties hereto request the ICC Court of Arbitration to
                attempt to appoint an arbitrator who is knowledgeable in the freight and
                software industries; if no such arbitrator can be appointed, the normal
                appointment process shall apply. The arbitration will take place
                internationally in the English language or Ethiopia in the Amharic
                language.</p>
            <b>9. General

                be found to be invalid or otherwise rendered unenforceable, such
                provision or provisions shall be severable from this Agreement so that the
                validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement
                shall not be affected thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
                that one or more of the provisions of Clause 8 hereof shall, at any time, be
                found to be invalid or otherwise rendered unenforceable, ebirr trading PLC
                shall have the right to elect to terminate this Agreement by giving
                Customer thirty (30) days prior notice of such election. In the event of such
                termination, Customer shall have no right to claim or receive damages of
                any kind or nature relating thereto.<br>
                2. Waiver. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or
                remedy with respect to any of the provisions of this Agreement shall
                operate as a waiver thereof.<br>
                3. Notices. All notices provided for herein shall be in writing and either
                delivered personally, by facsimile transmission or by prepaid registered
                mail, return receipt requested, to the addresses first above written. Either
                party may notify the other party by a notice given pursuant to the terms of
                this Clause of a change of the address to which notices hereunder shall be
                delivered or sent.<br>
                4. The parties to this agreement do not intend that any term of this
                agreement will be enforceable by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third
                Parties) Act 1999 (UK) by any person that is not a party to it.</p>
